Here we learn //
Proxy.. :: how to connect different different machine like react and vite and another library.. and actually what happen there is.. append half of the links backend and server like.. watchOut in server and vite.config.js > in this file..
CORS   :: CORE is like a there a have security guard that check which person is allowed or not.. that shit CORs...
axios :: it's also same like fetch method but here we get more feature as compare to fetch..
BadPractice :: app.use // this syntax followed or middleware.. like we create dist folder by running npm run build..
               // and then that folder move in backend then we write some code app.use ...watchOUT in server.js
..... FolderNames...
App.jsx
Server.js..
vite.config.js

common js and module js..
module js.. //-- asynchronously  // - if you want to use this you've to go in package.json and in type section.. you've to write "module"
import express from 'express' 

common js.. -- it'll come by synchronously 
const express = require("express");
